Project Title: 
    New York City Livability Index 
Project Description: 
    This project looks at 5 factors and uses user preference to calculate a livability score for New York City. 
    Those five factors are restaurants, crime, housing, health, and transit.
    The restaurant index is build based on factors such as violation count, amount of restaurants in a given census tract, how many times a restaurant was forced to close, and the average health code grade a restaurant got.  Similarly, the crime index is formulated based on three types of violations: Felony, Violation, and Misdemeanor. Health Index is built based on subfactors such as Water inspection results, Rodent inspection results, # of Influenza/Pneumonia admissions and # of EMS incidents. Our hypothesis is the last two subfactors are proxy to access to health care. The transit index combines data on bus subway stations, covered bus stops, and public bicycle parking, with more weight given to subway stations and less weight given to bicycle parking.

TRAITS CALCULATION AND INDEX CREATION
	INSTALLATION:
    		In order to install, please follow these steps: 
        		1. open final_notebook.ipynb in a python IDE 
        		2. Install all required packages
				- Numpy
				- Pandas
				- scikit-learn
				- decimal
				- census_geocoder
				- time
	EXECUTION:	
		1. open final_notebook.ipynb in a python IDE 	
		2. Set path variables
			- path: should lead to Data folder inside the project folder     
			- test_files: should lead to Code/Test_files located inside the proejct folder
		3a. to do a fresh run, set RAW_RUN to True and run all. This will take raw data located in the path folder and does a clean run.  This will output a CSV file inside the test_file + Final folder. 
		3b. to do a run based on already pre-processed data, set RAW_RUN to False and run all. This will pull in preprocessed data located inside the test_file path. This will output a CSV file inside the test_file + Final folder.
		NOTE: it is recommended to run using pre-processed data to save on run time.
		4. Follow the Visualization Execution steps in order to view the visual.
