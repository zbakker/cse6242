TRAITS CALCULATION AND INDEX CREATION
	INSTALLATION:
    		In order to install, please follow these steps: 
        		1. open final_notebook.ipynb in a python IDE 
        		2. Install all required packages
				- Numpy
				- Pandas
				- scikit-learn
				- decimal
				- census_geocoder
				- time
	EXECUTION:	
		1. open final_notebook.ipynb in a python IDE 	
		2. Set path variables
			- path: should lead to Data folder inside the project folder     
			- test_files: should lead to Code/Test_files located inside the proejct folder
		3a. to do a fresh run, set RAW_RUN to True and run all. This will take raw data located in the path folder and does a clean run.  This will output a CSV file inside the test_file + Final folder. 
		3b. to do a run based on already pre-processed data, set RAW_RUN to False and run all. This will pull in preprocessed data located inside the test_file path. This will output a CSV file inside the test_file + Final folder.
		NOTE: it is recommended to run using pre-processed data to save on run time.
		4. Take final_index.csv located inside Test_files/Final ADD PATH HERE WHEN DONE### ### ADD NEXT STEPS HERE####
